    <p class=blk1>Mr. and Mrs. Smith had a wonderful life.<br />
They were a normal, happy husband and wife.</p>
     
        
    <img src="animation2gif.gif" width=550px>
    <p class=blk2>One day they got news that made Mr. Smith glad.<br />
Mrs. Smith would would be a mum<br />
which would make him the dad!</p>
    
    <img src="animation3gif.gif" width=550px>
<p class=blk3>But something was wrong with their bundle of joy.<br />
It wasn't human at all,<br />
it was a robot boy...<br />
He wasn't warm and cuddly<br />
and he didn't have skin.<br />
Instead there was a cold, thin layer of tin.<br />
    There were wires and tubes sticking out of his head.<br />
He just lay there and stared,<br />
not living or dead.<br />
The only time he seemed alive at all<br />
was with a long extension cord<br />
plugged into the wall.</p>
        
    <img src="animation4gif.gif" width=550px>
<p class=blk4>Mr. Smith yelled at the doctor,<br />
"What have you done to my boy?<br />
He's not flesh and blood,<br />
he's aluminum alloy!" </p>
    
      <img src="animation5gif.gif" width="550px">
<p class=blk5>The doctor said gently,<br />
"What I'm going to say<br />
will sound pretty wild.<br />
But you're not the father <br />
of this strange looking child.<br />
You see, there still is some question<br />
about the child's gender,<br />
but we think that its father<br />
    is a microwave blender."</p>
  
     <img src="animation666.gif" width=550px>
<p class=blk6>The Smith's lives were now filled<br />
with misery and strife.<br />
Mrs. Smith hated her husband,<br />
and he hated his wife.<br />
He never forgave her unholy alliance:<br />
a sexual encounter<br />
with a kitchen appliance.</p>
   
     <img src="animation7.gif" width=550px>
<p class=blk7>And Robot Boy<br />
grew to be a young man.<br />
Though he was often mistaken<br />
for a garbage can.<br />
